To do
=====

- Add record keeping by tracking how often a question is asked and how often correctly answered, for each direction separately stored
- Add more command style interface, with commands to read, test, write, summarize, etc.
- Allow for random subset of file
- Speed up wordlist reading by using memory blocks of more than 1 entry in size
- Get license file
- Upload to open source site (same as Io?)
- Switch to JSON format file to allow for additional features; perhaps use http://lloydforge.org/projects/yajl/
- In new file format: code language name; allow for different types / times of comments
